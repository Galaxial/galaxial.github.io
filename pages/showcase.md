  The following are just a few of the design projects I've recently completed
  during my time at Conestoga College, soon to include a number of my own
  personal ventures as well.

# Elliot College of Design

![](/assets/img/uploads/Home_Screen.PNG)

Elliot College of Design is a fictitious school, imagined for the purposes of designing the graphic components of a functional website to serve the school. We were given a specific location where the school would be located, the values and inspirations the school intended to envelop, a bit into the local culture, and the academic focus of the institution. From there we were left on our own to heavily research the area's history, geography, cultural impacts and aboriginal culture. The school was intended to respect and emphasize it's indigenous roots and culture, but was primarily a design school focused on portraying an image of modernism and neo-developmental design principles.

 Wireframe construction, through multiple drafts refined the eventual layout. I chose to keep the interface as clean as possible to reduce visual clutter and improve accessibility concerns, as well. I put a special amount of work into choosing my colour palette so as to best reflect the local geography. The canadian shield boasts both large amounts of exposed rock, and resilient flora. I tried to utilize cool greys for both my content and navigation backgrounds, as well as in my own graphic pieces within the site as well as a cool green accent to mimic the natural surrounding environment while still keeping a minimal, modern website.

# Infographics: Pokemon Go Kitchener-Waterloo

![](/assets/img/uploads/a2-module-b.png)

This project we were tasked with creating a visually interesting info graphic, from concept, through data collection and modelling, to finalized product. We were free to choose the focus of our choosing, provided we were able to collect the associated data properly. I felt this was important because the line between still showcasing a relevant amount of data while still being visually appealing to look at is difficult to tread. I chose to examine 'raid activity' for the popular augmented-reality mobile game, pokemon go within the Kitchener-Waterloo area. I gathered data through crawling a very large online chat client server, dedicated to organizing the local community for this game, which gave me all the details I needed about who was doing what, when, how often, how successful they were, and so on. This resulted in a whole spreadsheet of data that needed to be filtered and prioritized. I knew I wanted to use some sort of map-representation of the game's activity relating to each of the different teams within the game, mostly to see if there was a relationship between a team and the type of area it typically had the most control over (teams within Pokemon go are typically attributed to different personality types, which at this large a scale seemed promising. 

There were far too many individual locations supported by the game to be visualized in anything other than a heat map, which I considered but did not feel was an engaging concept. I began by determining the areas with the highest activity over the duration recorded (two weeks) and created groupings of the many capture locations within those zones. Zones were picked due to their extraordinarily higher participation rates, dwarfing those outside of these zones. I then gathered the team control statistics and the most contested territory within those locations to determine each zone's control percentage by team. This left me with a good information set to represent, as I was then able to use the map as both a way to indicate data but also didn't need to be specific enough that it could also be used as a graphic design component. I used the percentages I had for each zone and created a pie chart, then layered an image of the most contested location of the associated zone over top of it to convey control while disguising the fact that they were simple graphs.
