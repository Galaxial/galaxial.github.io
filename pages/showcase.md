# Elliot College of Design

![](/assets/img/uploads/Home_Screen.PNG)

Elliot College of Design is a fictitious school, imagined for the purposes of designing the graphic components of a functional website to serve the school. We were given a specific location where the school would be located, the values and inspirations the school intended to envelop, a bit into the local culture, and the academic focus of the institution. From there we were left on our own to heavily research the area's history, geography, cultural impacts and aboriginal culture. The school was intended to respect and emphasize it's indigenous roots and culture, but was primarily a design school focused on portraying an image of modernism and neo-developmental design principles.

 Wireframe construction, through multiple drafts refined the eventual layout. I chose to keep the interface as clean as possible to reduce visual clutter and improve accessibility concerns, as well.
