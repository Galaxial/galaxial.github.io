  My Name is Noah Zenker, current student enrolled in Conestoga College's I.T Innovation and Design Program. An almost oxymoronic focus of this program is that we explore and hone skills in a very wide variety of fields across the information technology sector, ranging from software development programming, to UX psychology and accessibility, to graphic design. As such, this site will serve to currate my work across all of these fields.
